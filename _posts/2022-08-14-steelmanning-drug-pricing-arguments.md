# Steelmanning drug pricing arguments v1

![](/assets/Steelman.png)

Attacking a [strawman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) is a form of fallacious argument in which opponents of a particular proposition attack a weaker, but superficially similar, version of that proposition in order to make it easier for them to "win" the argument. Strawmanning is particularly pernicious when used as a bad-faith rhetorical technique to lead non-expert audiences to false conclusions.

The opposite of strawmanning is known as [steelmanning](https://themindcollection.com/steelmanning-how-to-discover-the-truth-by-helping-your-opponent/?utm_source=pocket_mylist): attacking the strongest form of your opponent's argument. By wilfully crafting the best argument you can for your opponent you gain a better understanding of their position, and by extension, your position too. Forcing yourself into a good-faith dialectic helps you come closer to uncovering the truth.

Drug pricing is a contentious and emotionally charged topic often subject to motivated reasoning. In the spirit of truth-seeking, I thought it would be an interesting exercise to steelman three opposing propositions which can be accessed through the links below:
1. 
2. Why governments should set pharmaceutical prices
3. Why the pharmaceutical industry should be a state-owned, not for profit industry which uses taxes to develop and provide drugs at no additional charge to taxpayers

AUTHOR NOTE: ARGUMENTS 2 AND 3 ARE IN PROGRESS AND COMING SOON!

Personally, I tend to find the most convincing arguments to be those for a form of free pricing with regulatory oversight to prevent the worst excesses of rent-seeking behaviour[^1] - but then again, I do work in the industry so I am biased. 

I consider these to be unrefined beta versions, yet to be forged in the fires of public scrutiny. So if you, dear reader, think you can make one of these arguments better or identify an error or piece of fallacious reasoning I'll be grateful if you let me know on Twitter and I'll add it to the list of updates for v2!
