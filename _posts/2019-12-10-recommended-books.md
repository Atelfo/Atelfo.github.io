title: "My book recommendations (updated anually)"
---

This is a list of my personal favourite books and ones that stuck with me, shaped my thinking, or were particularly memorable. Not necessarily the most well-written.

I update this list each December with the 5 or so best books that I read for the first time in that year, regardless of when they were originally released.
