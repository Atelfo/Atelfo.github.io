# Invisible cities: A curated collection of GauGAN2 generated citiscapes generated with text inputs from Italo Calvino's novel

AI generated art is something I find fascinating; there's real potential for it to bring us to a post-scarcity state of art commoditization. An impressive recent development in this space is NVIDIA's recently  released web-based tool "GauGAN2" that can generate landscapes from text, sketch or image input using a generative adversarial network (publically available [here](http://gaugan.org/gaugan2/)). 

I decided to test GauGAN2 by feeding it text sequences from Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities, which has a nice mix of city descriptions that range from concrete and specific to highly abstract or conceptual. I ended up liking the results enough to compile them into a PDF, which I've linked below (an example of one of the 55 cities is at the top of this post).

I had to sift through a lot of unappealing outputs to make my selections (I considered roughly 10% of outputs to be "good"), and there were certain prompts which did not generate any results I was particularly happy with (e.g. Andria, Perinthia, Olinda, Baucis and Zobeide). However, I found some of the results to be genuinely appealing, evocative and artful (especially Maurilia, Sophronia, Aglaura, Octavia and Leonia). 

Vague descriptions like "Aglaura" generate a lot of trash, but also some of the most interesting and evocative results. In contrast, more explicit prompts like the one for "Valdrada" seem to reliably generate photorealistic scenes that accurately match the description in the text but rarely one that is truly unexpected or interesting. It makes sense intuitively that the most interesting AI art is going to come from selecting prompts which are expressive without overly specifying or constraining the output space, thereby leaving the model some room for "creativity" without giving it so much freedom that it generates wild uncoordinated messes. 

One other thing that is hard to control is how much weight the model assigns to a particular concept or word in the prompt. Certain words seemed to be particularly "powerful" and had a tendency to drive the outputs more than others, for example, mentioning celestial objects like in "Andria", "Perinthia" and "Zobeide" led the model to invariably output astronomical images even if the description as a whole referred to a city.

Overall, I think GauGAN2 performed admirably and I'm interested to see what future iterations produce with the same prompts. In time, I expect generative art tools like GauGAN2 to do the same thing to digital art as the camera did to still life painting and portraiture, i.e. reducing the public's appreciation of the artform while simultaneously democratizing access to its production. When everyone can generate an infinite number of masterworks at will we'll be forced to evaluate art by criteria independent of the work in itself if we want to retain some scarcity and ability to distinguish between "good" and "bad" art. Or, we may see an elevation of the role of "art curator" beyond that of the artist.
