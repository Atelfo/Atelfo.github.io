> *"The old saw in real estate is location, location, location, and in biotech I've always felt it's focus, focus focus"* \- Fred Price

- The moral of the story, if any, is that success comes when you pick a focus, stick to your area of expertise and play to your strengths. In the case of BioMarin, its strengths were (and are) in rare diseases, enzyme replacement therapies and manufacturing of complex biologics
- BioMarin managed to escape the trap of becoming dependent on its partner Genzyme by continuing to invest in manufacturing capabilities despite Genzyme's desire to take over manufacturing of Aldurazyme. In the end, Genzyme was compelled to essentially fund BioMarin's manufacturing build-up as taking over became uneconomical (pg. 39)
- Standardized baseline measurements in duplicate before dosing in a clinical trial are critical for negating variability in noisy measures such as the six minute walk test (pg. 160)
- BioMarin's acquisition of Orapred took it into general pediatrics and was a "near-death" experience for the company, losing it significant amounts of money. The failure of the Orapred acquisition taught BioMarin that companies should do what they do best, and to be wary of acquisitions that would suddenly reshape the company (pg. 178)
- BioMarin learned to "engage with the scientific community early" to identify promising new targets and treatments (pg. 178)
- BioMarin's research and development process seeks to establish a "Big effect" before progressing treatments into human trials - qualitative rather than just quantitative differences in outcomes (pg. 185)
- Most companies that have a drug approved by the FDA do not get a second one approved, often because of acquisitions (pg. 207)
	-  Only 10% of companies with their first drug approved between 2001 and 2010 had another one approved later. Only 20% of companies in this group were still active a and independent 10 years later
