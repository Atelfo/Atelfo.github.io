<meta name="twitter:description" content="Mapping the chain of discoveries and innovations that led to the development of Enhertu">

Forty years ago the Japanese yoghurt drink company Yakult decided it needed to diversity its business and set up a pharmaceuticals division. This decision was one of the many historical contingencies that eventually lead to the discovery and development of arguably the most effective breast cancer drug yet, trastuzumab deruxtecan (brand name Enhertu).

Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca's Enhertu is a member of the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) class of drugs. ADCs are built from three main components: a targeting antibody, a chemotherapeutic drug payload, and a chemical linker that joins the antibody to the payload. By using an antibody to direct chemotherapy drugs to specific tumour-associated antigens, the hope is that chemotherapy molecules can be concentrated at the site of the tumour where they are more likely to effectively kill cancer cells and less likely to cause dose-limiting side effects. Although ADCs faced a number of setbacks since the first attempts in the 1960s, particularly related to toxicity, the technology has now matured enough to deliver multiple highly effective treatments for cancer.

In the below graphic I have outlined the chain of discoveries and innovations that led eventually to Enhertu. Modern drugs like Enhertu are the result of many converging nonlinear lines of inquiry, and it's somewhat arbitrary where to start the mapping and what to include. For instance, although inventions like the polymerase chain reaction, agarose gel electrophoresis, and cell culture were crucial developments, I have mostly left out general purpose biological tools and techniques.

<i>Discoveries and innovations from academia (marked with circles), government (marked with triangles), and the private sector (marked with squares) all played a role in the discovery of Enhertu. Events related to the chemotherapy payload are displayed on the far left section in light green, those related to the ADC and linker are second from the left in teal, those related to the antibody are third from the left in blue, and target-related events are on the right in purple. Clicking on an event opens up a link to the source publication.<i>
